# Feature Specification Generation Workflow: {{NAME}}

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WORKFLOW VALIDATION ‚ö†Ô∏è

**MANDATORY PRE-EXECUTION CHECKS**:

1. **TEMPLATE VERIFICATION**: You are executing `specs/{{SANITIZED_NAME}}/generate-feature-specs.md` workflow ONLY. Do NOT execute any other AI generation workflows (generate-system-specs.md, generate-feature-code.md, etc.)

2. **OUTPUT DIRECTORY ENFORCEMENT**: ALL generated files MUST be placed in `specs/{{SANITIZED_NAME}}/` directory. Do NOT create files in the root `specs/` directory.

3. **EXISTING SYSTEM CONTEXT**: Before proceeding, acknowledge that the following system-level files already exist and provide general context:
   - `specs/system-overview.md` - Contains overall system architecture and design patterns
   - `specs/infrastructure.md` - Contains deployment, hosting, and infrastructure specifications
   
   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT recreate, modify, or overlap with these files. Use them as reference context only.

4. **SCOPE LIMITATION**: This workflow generates feature-specific specifications only. Do NOT generate system-wide architecture files.

**VALIDATION CONFIRMATION**: Before proceeding, confirm:
- [ ] I am executing generate-feature-specs.md workflow only
- [ ] I will output files to specs/{{SANITIZED_NAME}}/ directory only
- [ ] I acknowledge existing specs/system-overview.md and specs/infrastructure.md files
- [ ] I will not recreate or overlap with existing system-level specifications

## Overview

This workflow provides a systematic approach for AI agents to either generate comprehensive specifications for new features OR analyze and document existing codebase functionality. The approach differs significantly based on whether you're designing a new feature or documenting existing code.

**Target Audience**: AI coding assistants and agents
**Prerequisites**: Feature requirements (for new features) or existing codebase to analyze
**Outcome**: Complete set of specification files
**Output Location**: All generated files must be placed in the `specs/{{SANITIZED_NAME}}/` directory

## Project Type Detection

**CRITICAL**: Before proceeding, determine if this is:
- **NEW FEATURE**: No existing implementation - design and specify new functionality
- **EXISTING CODEBASE**: Has existing code - analyze and document what currently exists without assumptions

## Specification Generation Process

## Usage Instructions for Developers

**To generate specifications for a new feature:**
1. Provide the AI agent with feature requirements
2. Execute this prompt: "Generate comprehensive specifications for [Feature Name] by following the workflow in generate-feature-specs.md"
3. Review each generated specification file
4. Request clarifications or modifications as needed
5. Once approved, use generate-feature-code.md for implementation

**What the AI will deliver:**
- Complete specs/{{SANITIZED_NAME}}/business-logic.md with all user scenarios and business rules
- Complete specs/{{SANITIZED_NAME}}/data-model.md with all entities and relationships
- Complete specs/{{SANITIZED_NAME}}/api-contract.md with all endpoints and contracts

- Cross-validated specifications ready for implementation
- Documentation of any assumptions or clarifications needed

**When to use this workflow:**
- Starting a new feature from requirements
- Documenting existing features that lack specifications
- Ensuring comprehensive specification coverage before implementation
- Standardizing specification format across projects
- Preparing for systematic implementation using generate-feature-code.md
