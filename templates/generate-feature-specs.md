# Feature Specification Workflow: {{NAME}}

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WORKFLOW VALIDATION ‚ö†Ô∏è

**MANDATORY PRE-EXECUTION CHECKS**:

1. **TEMPLATE VERIFICATION**: You are executing `specs/{{SANITIZED_NAME}}/generate-feature-specs.md` workflow ONLY. Do NOT execute any other AI generation workflows (generate-system-specs.md, generate-feature-code.md, etc.)

2. **OUTPUT DIRECTORY ENFORCEMENT**: ALL generated files MUST be placed in `specs/{{SANITIZED_NAME}}/` directory. Do NOT create files in the root `specs/` directory.

3. **EXISTING SYSTEM CONTEXT**: Before proceeding, acknowledge that the following system-level files already exist and provide general context:
   - `specs/system-overview.md` - Contains overall system architecture and design patterns
   - `specs/infrastructure.md` - Contains deployment, hosting, and infrastructure specifications
   
   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT recreate, modify, or overlap with these files. Use them as reference context only.

4. **SCOPE LIMITATION**: This workflow generates feature-specific specifications only. Do NOT generate system-wide architecture files.

**VALIDATION CONFIRMATION**: Before proceeding, confirm:
- [ ] I am executing generate-feature-specs.md workflow only
- [ ] I will output files to specs/{{SANITIZED_NAME}}/ directory only
- [ ] I acknowledge existing specs/system-overview.md and specs/infrastructure.md files
- [ ] I will not recreate or overlap with existing system-level specifications

## Overview

This workflow provides a systematic approach for AI agents to either generate comprehensive specifications for new features OR analyze and document existing codebase functionality. The approach differs significantly based on whether you're designing a new feature or documenting existing code.

**Target Audience**: AI coding assistants and agents
**Prerequisites**: Feature requirements (for new features) or existing codebase to analyze
**Outcome**: Complete set of specification files
**Output Location**: All generated files must be placed in the `specs/{{SANITIZED_NAME}}/` directory

## Pre-Specification Question Tracking

**CRITICAL**: During specification generation, document all open questions and ambiguities that require developer input. Never stop specification generation - instead document questions and proceed with reasonable assumptions.

### QUESTIONS.md File Structure
