# {{NAME}} Development Progress (Existing Codebase)

## Overview
This guide helps you systematically enhance your existing project using AI assistance. The AI will analyze your current codebase and create specifications, then implement new features following the structured workflow in `ai-workflow.md`.

**How to use this guide:**
1. Complete each checkbox in order
2. Copy and paste the provided AI prompts exactly
3. Review AI outputs before proceeding to the next step
4. The AI will analyze your existing code and work systematically

## Phase 1: Codebase Analysis & Specification

### [ ] Step 1.1: System Analysis & Overview
- **Execute this AI prompt to analyze and document your system:**
    ```
    Analyze the entire codebase and create a comprehensive system overview by filling out /specs/system-overview.md using the template structure. Document the current architecture, technology stack, and high-level system design based on the existing code.
    ```
- **Review** `/specs/system-overview.md` and approve or request changes

### [ ] Step 1.2: Infrastructure Analysis
- **Execute this AI prompt to analyze and document your infrastructure:**
    ```
    Analyze the entire project and fill out /specs/infrastructure.md using the template structure. Document the current build and deployment process, including tools, scripts, and deployment environments.
    ```
- **Review** `/specs/infrastructure.md` and approve or request changes

### [ ] Step 1.3: Common Specification Generation
- **Run** `specs add-feature common` to add required files to your project
- **Execute this AI prompt to create common project specifications:**
    ```
    Analyze the entire codebase and fill out all specification files in /specs/common/ (business-logic.md, data-model.md, api-contract.md, ui-design.md) using their template structures. Document the current implementation accurately and identify areas for improvement. Only specify what can be clearly identified from the existing code.
    ```
- **Review** all generated specifications in `/specs/common/` and approve or request changes

### [ ] Step 1.4: Feature Planning
- **Run** `specs add-feature [Feature Name]` to add required files to your project
- **Execute this AI prompt to plan the feature:**
    ```
    Fill out all files in specs/[Feature Directory] directory using the template structure of each file.
    Feature requirements: [Add your feature requirements here]
    ```
- **Review** all files in `specs/[Feature Directory]/` and approve or request changes

## Phase 2: Feature Implementation

### [ ] Step 2.1: Complete Feature Implementation
- **Execute this AI prompt to implement the feature:**
    ```
    Implement the feature by following the workflow in ai-workflow.md
    ```
- **Monitor progress** - The AI will work through all phases automatically
- **Review issues** in ISSUES.md file for any implementation issues or assumptions
- **Review implementation** when AI completes and reports success

### [ ] Step 2.2: Final Validation
- **Test the complete application** to ensure it meets your requirements
- **Review documentation** generated by the AI
- **Verify deployment** is working correctly
- **Remove file** ai-workflow.md from specs/[Feature Directory]/

## Quick Reference

**What the AI will do automatically:**
- Follow the systematic 5-phase implementation workflow
- Implement data models, APIs, business logic, and UI
- Create comprehensive tests (>80% coverage)
- Deploy according to infrastructure specifications
- Generate documentation and implementation summary

**When the AI will ask for help:**
- Missing or incomplete specifications
- Conflicting requirements
- Technical decisions not covered in specifications
- Clarification on acceptance criteria

**Your role:**
- Provide clear project requirements
- Review and approve specifications
- Test and validate the final implementation
- Make decisions when the AI requests clarification
