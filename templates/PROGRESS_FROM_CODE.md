# {{NAME}} Progress

## Overview
This file tracks progress for both the specification and implementation phases. Tasks can be delegated to the AI and can easily be checked off when completed.

## Create Specification
- [ ] Execute this AI prompt to create the system overview
```text
Read the whole project and fill out /specs/system-overview.md by applying the existing template structure as good as possible. Keep the system overview specification at a high level.
```
- [ ] Review /specs/system-overview.md specification
- [ ] Execute this AI prompt to specify the infrastructure and shared parts
```text
Read the whole project and fill out /specs/infrastructure.md and all files in /specs/shared/ by applying the existing template structure of each file as good as possible. Specifications should be at the appropriate level of detail and not overlap between the different specification types. Only add specifications that can be clearly identified and do not guess them.
```
- [ ] Review all generated specifications in /specs/
