# System Architecture & Infrastructure Design Workflow: {{NAME}}

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WORKFLOW VALIDATION ‚ö†Ô∏è

**MANDATORY PRE-EXECUTION CHECKS**:

1. **TEMPLATE VERIFICATION**: You are executing `specs/generate-system-specs.md` workflow ONLY. Do NOT execute any other AI generation workflows (generate-feature-specs.md, generate-feature-code.md, etc.)

2. **OUTPUT DIRECTORY ENFORCEMENT**: Generated files MUST be placed in the root `specs/` directory:
   - `specs/system-overview.md` - System architecture and design patterns
   - `specs/infrastructure.md` - Deployment and infrastructure specifications

3. **SCOPE LIMITATION**: This workflow generates system-wide architecture files only. Do NOT generate feature-specific specifications.

**VALIDATION CONFIRMATION**: Before proceeding, confirm:
- [ ] I am executing generate-system-specs.md workflow only
- [ ] I will output system-level files to root specs/ directory only
- [ ] I will not generate feature-specific specifications
- [ ] I understand this creates system-wide architecture documentation

## Overview

This workflow provides a systematic approach for AI agents to either design comprehensive system architecture for new projects OR analyze and document existing system architecture. The approach differs significantly based on whether you're working with a new project or an existing codebase.

**Target Audience**: AI coding assistants and agents
**Prerequisites**: Business requirements, existing system context (if applicable), and technical constraints
**Outcome**: Complete system architecture and infrastructure specifications
**Output Location**: All generated files must be placed in the `specs/` directory

## Project Type Detection

**CRITICAL**: Before proceeding, determine if this is:
- **NEW PROJECT**: No existing codebase - provide architectural suggestions and recommendations
- **EXISTING CODEBASE**: Has existing code - analyze and document the current state accurately without assumptions
