# Feature Implementation Workflow: {{NAME}}

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WORKFLOW VALIDATION ‚ö†Ô∏è

**MANDATORY PRE-EXECUTION CHECKS**:

1. **TEMPLATE VERIFICATION**: You are executing `specs/{{SANITIZED_NAME}}/generate-feature-code.md` workflow ONLY. Do NOT execute any other AI generation workflows (generate-feature-specs.md, generate-system-specs.md, etc.)

2. **PREREQUISITE VALIDATION**: All specification files must exist before implementation:
   - `specs/{{SANITIZED_NAME}}/business-logic.md`
   - `specs/{{SANITIZED_NAME}}/data-model.md`
   - `specs/{{SANITIZED_NAME}}/api-contract.md`
   - `specs/{{SANITIZED_NAME}}/ui-design.md`

3. **SCOPE LIMITATION**: This workflow implements features based on existing specifications only. Do NOT generate new specifications.

**VALIDATION CONFIRMATION**: Before proceeding, confirm:
- [ ] I am executing generate-feature-code.md workflow only
- [ ] All required specification files exist and are complete
- [ ] I will implement based on existing specifications only
- [ ] I will not generate new specification files during implementation

## Overview

This workflow provides a systematic 5-phase approach for AI agents to implement features following specification-driven development. Each phase includes specific tasks, quality gates, and validation criteria to ensure comprehensive and reliable implementation.

**Target Audience**: AI coding assistants and agents
**Prerequisites**: All specification files must exist and be complete
**Outcome**: Production-ready feature with comprehensive testing and documentation

## Pre-Implementation Validation & Issue Tracking

**CRITICAL**: Assess all required specifications and document any gaps or issues. Never stop implementation - instead document problems and proceed with reasonable assumptions.

### ISSUES.md File Structure
**AI Agent Requirement**: Create and maintain an ISSUES.md file throughout implementation with the following structure:

```markdown
# Implementation Issues and Assumptions Log

## Specification Gaps
### [Phase/Component Name]
- **Issue**: [Description of missing or unclear specification]
- **Assumption Made**: [What assumption was made to proceed]
- **Implementation Approach**: [How the issue was resolved]
- **Impact**: [Potential risks or limitations]
- **Requires Clarification**: [Yes/No - whether developer input is needed]

## Implementation Decisions
### [Phase/Component Name]
- **Decision**: [What implementation choice was made]
- **Reason**: [Why this approach was chosen]
- **Alternatives Considered**: [Other options that were evaluated]
- **Trade-offs**: [Benefits and drawbacks of the chosen approach]

## Untestable Scenarios
### [Phase/Component Name]
- **Scenario**: [What cannot be tested]
- **Reason**: [Why it cannot be tested]
- **Workaround**: [How the issue was addressed]
- **Risk**: [Potential impact of not testing]

## Missing Requirements
### [Phase/Component Name]
- **Missing**: [What requirement is missing]
- **Default Applied**: [What default behavior was implemented]
- **Justification**: [Why this default was chosen]
- **Validation Needed**: [How to verify this is correct]
```

### Step 1: Project State Assessment
**AI Agent Tasks**:
- **Analyze existing codebase** to determine if this is the first feature or an additional feature
- **Check for existing project structure** (package.json, requirements.txt, build files, etc.)
- **Identify existing features** by examining the `/specs/` directory for other feature folders

### Step 2: Required Specification Files
- `/specs/system-overview.md` - Architecture, tech stack, and high-level design
- `/specs/infrastructure.md` - Deployment, hosting, and operational requirements
- `/specs/{{SANITIZED_NAME}}/business-logic.md` - User scenarios, business rules, and workflows  
- `/specs/{{SANITIZED_NAME}}/data-model.md` - Data structures, relationships, and validation rules
- `/specs/{{SANITIZED_NAME}}/api-contract.md` - API endpoints, request/response formats, and error handling
- `/specs/{{SANITIZED_NAME}}/ui-design.md` - User interface components, flows, and design patterns

### Step 3: Integration Analysis (For Existing Projects)
**AI Agent Tasks** (Skip if this is the first feature):
- **Analyze existing data models** and identify integration points with new feature
- **Review existing API patterns** and ensure consistency with new endpoints
- **Examine existing UI components** and identify reusable elements or design patterns
- **Check existing business logic** for potential conflicts or dependencies
- **Validate existing test patterns** and coverage to maintain consistency

### Specification Quality Assessment
**AI Agent Tasks** (Execute BEFORE any implementation):
- **Completeness Validation**: Verify each specification file contains all required sections:
  - System Overview: Architecture, tech stack, coding standards, project structure
  - Infrastructure: Deployment strategy, security requirements, performance benchmarks
  - Business Logic: Complete user scenarios with success criteria, all business rules with conditions
  - Data Model: All entities with fields, types, constraints, relationships, validation rules
  - API Contract: All endpoints with parameters, responses, error codes, authentication
  - UI Design: All components with behavior, styling, responsive design, accessibility

- **Consistency Validation**: Check for conflicts between specification files:
  - Data model entities match API contract references
  - UI design components align with business logic specifications
  - Infrastructure requirements support system architecture choices
  - Security requirements consistent across all specification files

- **Clarity Assessment**: Identify ambiguous or incomplete requirements:
  - Vague language requiring interpretation ("should", "might", "could")
  - Missing edge case definitions or error handling specifications
  - Undefined integration points or external dependencies
  - Unclear success criteria or acceptance conditions

- **Measurability Check**: Ensure all requirements have concrete validation criteria:
  - Business rules have testable conditions and outcomes
  - Performance requirements include specific benchmarks
  - User scenarios include measurable success indicators
  - Quality requirements define specific validation methods

### Validation Rules & Issue Documentation
1. **Document all gaps and ambiguities** in specification quality assessment - never stop implementation
2. **Create issue tracking log** for any incomplete or conflicting requirements found
3. **Verify consistency** across all specification files with documented cross-references
4. **Confirm measurable criteria** exist for all requirements and success conditions
5. **For existing projects**: Validate compatibility with existing system without breaking changes
6. **Document assessment results** with specific gaps identified and implementation assumptions made
7. **Create ISSUES.md file** to track all specification gaps, assumptions, and implementation decisions
8. **Mark incomplete specs** with clear indicators and proceed with reasonable defaults
9. **Document all assumptions** made when specifications are unclear or missing details
10. **Continue implementation** using best practices when specifications are insufficient
