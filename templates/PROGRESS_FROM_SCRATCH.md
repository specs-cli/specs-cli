# {{NAME}} Development Progress

## Overview
This guide helps you systematically develop your project from scratch using AI assistance. Each step includes specific prompts to give to your AI agent, which will follow the structured workflow in `ai-workflow.md` to finally implement your project and features.

**How to use this guide:**
1. Complete each checkbox in order
2. Copy and paste the provided AI prompts exactly
3. Review AI outputs before proceeding to the next step
4. The AI will follow the systematic workflow automatically

## Phase 1: Project Specification

### [ ] Step 1.1: System Overview
- **Execute this AI prompt to create the system overview:**
    ```
    Create a comprehensive system overview by filling out system-overview.md using the template structure. Ask for clarification if any information is missing. 
    Project description: [Add your brief project description here]
    ```
- **Review** `system-overview.md` and approve or request changes

### [ ] Step 1.2: Infrastructure Planning
- **Execute this AI prompt to specify infrastructure:**
    ```
    Fill out infrastructure.md using the template structure. Focus on deployment, hosting, and operational requirements.
    Infrastructure requirements: [Add your deployment, hosting, and operational requirements here]
    ```
- **Review** `infrastructure.md` and approve or request changes

### [ ] Step 1.3: Feature Planning
- **Run** `specs add-feature [Feature Name]` to add required files to your project
- **Execute this AI prompt to plan the feature:**
    ```
    Fill out all files in specs/[Feature Directory]/ (business-logic.md, data-model.md, api-contract.md, ui-design.md) directory using their template structures.
    Feature requirements: [Add your feature requirements here]
    ```
- **Review** all files in `specs/[Feature Directory]/` and approve or request changes

## Phase 2: Feature Implementation

### [ ] Step 2.1: Complete Feature Implementation
- **Execute this AI prompt to implement the feature:**
    ```
    Implement the feature by following the workflow in ai-workflow.md
    ```
- **Monitor progress** - The AI will work through all phases automatically
- **Review issues** in ISSUES.md file for any implementation issues or assumptions
- **Review implementation** when AI completes and reports success

### [ ] Step 2.2: Final Validation
- **Test the complete application** to ensure it meets your requirements
- **Review documentation** generated by the AI
- **Verify deployment** is working correctly
- **Remove file** ai-workflow.md from specs/[Feature Directory]/

## Quick Reference

**What the AI will do automatically:**
- Follow the systematic 5-phase implementation workflow
- Set up project structure and dependencies
- Implement data models, APIs, business logic, and UI
- Create comprehensive tests (>80% coverage)
- Deploy according to infrastructure specifications
- Generate documentation and implementation summary

**When the AI will ask for help:**
- Missing or incomplete specifications
- Conflicting requirements
- Technical decisions not covered in specifications
- Clarification on acceptance criteria

**Your role:**
- Provide clear project requirements
- Review and approve specifications
- Test and validate the final implementation
- Make decisions when the AI requests clarification
